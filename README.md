# Tax in Ethiopia
Tax in Ethiopia came up after stumbling across import/export data from the Ethiopian Customs and Revenue Authority (ERCA) It's incredibly useful data but not presented well (basic spreadsheets) so I decided to come up with a few indicators when I had a little free time and paired them with a simple JS visualisation library ([ChartJS]) and [Mapbox].

As of this commit, the raw Excel spreadsheets can be found on [ERCA's] website. Get it while it's hot.
